### **A Journey from Plans to Adventures**

It all started as a simple Google Meet discussion among four friends about planning a trip to Nepal. From debating itineraries to casually browsing flight fares, the conversation quickly took an unexpected turn when we stumbled upon amazing deals for flights from Hyderabad to Lucknow. Without a second thought—and zero planning—we booked the tickets. The thrill of spontaneity had taken over!

Fast forward a week, and reality struck. A friend from Lucknow warned us about Nepal's cold and bad weather, putting the idea of trekking there on ice—literally. The initial excitement gave way to uncertainty, but only for a moment. Just two days later, one of us stumbled upon mesmerizing trekking posts on Instagram featuring the Kedarkantha trek. Inspired by the stunning snow-covered trails and the promise of adventure, we made a new plan: Uttarakhand and Kedarkantha, here we come!

Our journey began early in the morning as we set off from Hyderabad, buzzing with excitement. After landing at Lucknow airport, hunger dictated our next move. We headed straight to the iconic “Sharma Ji Ka Chai” for a hearty breakfast. The chai was warm, the samosas crisp, and the atmosphere lively. While indulging, we planned to order chole bhature as the pièce de résistance—but somehow, we never got around to it.

This impromptu adventure is shaping up to be one for the books. Uttarakhand and the Kedarkantha trek await, promising snowy trails, starry skies, and memories to last a lifetime.

### **The Journey Picks Up Pace: From Lucknow to Dehradun**

After savoring our breakfast at Sharma Ji Ka Chai, we hopped on a bus to Sitapur to meet Ankit, a district educational officer, and the proud owner of a Suzuki Brezza CNG. The plan was to pick him up and hit the road in his car for the rest of the trip.

When we arrived in Sitapur, we gave Ankit a call, and soon enough, he appeared—not in the Brezza, but on a scooty, grinning and laughing as he approached us from his office. It turned out that Ankit didn’t know how to drive the car, so he took Goutham along to fetch it while the rest of us waited at the bus stop.

After what felt like ages, they finally arrived with the car. Loading our luggage was a challenge, thanks to the CNG tank occupying most of the boot space. With some creative packing (and a lot of squishing), we managed to fit half the luggage in the boot and kept the rest between our legs. By this point, we were starving, and Ankit, a true Lucknowite, knew just the place to take us for a proper feast.

The restaurant he picked did not disappoint. The non-veg lunch was nothing short of a culinary delight—rich flavors, hearty portions, and just the right fuel we needed for the long drive ahead.

With full stomachs and high spirits, we began our journey from Lucknow to Dehradun around 4 PM. The road ahead stretched over 560 km, and we needed to reach Dehradun by 8:30 AM the next day, as the trekking company, Trekmount, had arranged a traveler to pick us up for the Kedarkantha trek.

The drive was long, but the excitement of what lay ahead kept us going. From random conversations and jokes to scenic glimpses outside, every moment added to the adventure. Sleep-deprived yet eager, we were on the cusp of experiencing something unforgettable. Kedarkantha and its snow-clad trails were calling, and we were answering with open hearts and packed bags!


### **The Toll Trouble and Arrival in Dehradun**

The drive from Lucknow to Dehradun was shaping up to be an eventful journey, and not just because of the long hours on the road. As we approached our first toll gate, we were hit with a realization: our car’s FASTag balance was negative, and the account was hot-listed by the State Bank of India. Despite an immediate recharge, the balance didn’t reflect in the system. With no choice, we paid double the toll in cash and moved on, hoping the problem would sort itself out before the next toll.

Two hours later, we arrived at another toll gate, brimming with confidence that the FASTag account would have been updated by now. But to our shock, it hadn’t. The toll operator sympathized with our situation, explaining it wasn’t our fault and even provided a toll-free number to contact the bank. After several frustrating attempts to connect, we finally spoke to a customer service agent, who informed us it would take more time to reflect and advised us to send a support email. We sent the email immediately but still had to pay double the toll in cash again.

By the time we hit the third toll, frustration levels were peaking. However, luck was on our side this time. The toll operator, coincidentally from Ankit’s hometown of Sitapur, recognized Ankit as a district educational officer. With a little bit of small-town VIP charm, we were allowed to pass using a VIP pass. And just as our patience was running out, the FASTag account finally activated at the next toll, much to our collective relief.

The drive continued through the night, with Goutham, Prudhvi, and Umesh taking turns behind the wheel while Ankit and I (Anil) chilled in the backseat. After hours of non-stop driving, we reached Dehradun at 5 AM, exhausted but excited for the trek ahead.

Once there, we decided to park the Brezza in Dehradun for the next four days. But before anything else, we desperately needed a place to freshen up. Ankit and Umesh, in particular, were on the verge of a crisis, but every hotel we approached quoted sky-high prices. After a frustrating search, we finally found a place willing to let us use a room for just two hours—but at a steep cost of ₹2000. Though the price felt unreasonable, we reluctantly agreed for the sake of Ankit and Umesh, who were the ones most in need.

Ironically, once we checked in, Ankit and Umesh, the ones clamoring for a bathroom, took their sweet time freshening up while the rest of us waited. Their sense of urgency had apparently vanished! By the time we were all ready, the day had started, and our excitement for the Kedarkantha trek was at an all-time high.


### **The Journey to Sankri: From Laughs to Tight Grips**

After freshening up and catching a breather, we made our way to the Dehradun railway station, our designated pickup point. There, we met six other guys joining us for the trek. The mood took a nosedive, especially for Umesh, when we realized there were no girls in our group—a minor setback for the more romantically inclined among us.

Among the new faces, Yuvraj and Maddy were representatives from our trekking company, Trekmount, while the other four guys belonged to a different group. Their company name escaped us, but that didn’t matter. What lay ahead was a long, adventurous drive to Sankri, the base camp village for the Kedarkantha trek.

Once on the road, exhaustion took over, and most of us drifted into sleep as the driver expertly navigated the hilly terrain. We woke up occasionally for meals, enjoying hearty North Indian food that gave us much-needed energy for the journey.

As we ascended further into the mountains, the roads grew narrower, the curves sharper, and the edges steeper. The route was both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly dangerous. By the time darkness enveloped the hills, the mud roads and lack of visible signage made navigation nearly impossible. Despite these challenges, our driver pressed on with remarkable confidence, though we clung to our seats for dear life during particularly harrowing stretches.

At one point, the driver called someone from the trekking company to confirm the route. After dropping off the four guys from the other company at their base camp, we continued toward Sankri. The final stretch was nerve-wracking, with every twist and turn keeping us on edge.

Finally, around 8:30 PM, we arrived at Sankri village, where our trekking base camp awaited us. Tired but excited, we unloaded our gear, took a deep breath of the cold mountain air, and let the reality of our adventure sink in. The Kedarkantha trek was no longer just a plan—it was about to become an experience we’d never forget.



### **The Beginning of the Trek: Laughter, Challenges, and Bonding at Juda Ka Talab**

As we reached the base camp, we were greeted by our guide, Bikshu Sharma—a thin, bearded guy about our age with a great sense of humor and a grounded demeanor. His warm welcome instantly put us at ease. He had dinner arranged by a cozy campfire, where we enjoyed the cold mountain breeze, hearty food, and the incredible backdrop of towering peaks. It was the perfect start to our trek.

Bikshu's team handed us our trekking kits, including jackets, trousers, trekking sticks, shoes, headlamps, and gloves, ensuring we were well-prepared for the days ahead. The next morning, everyone freshened up with hot water, except for me. Thanks to power fluctuations, I ended up bathing in icy water. My legs froze, and my hands lost sensation for what felt like an eternity.

With the essentials packed and the rest of our belongings left behind at the base camp, we were ready to start our four-day trek. True to his word, Umesh carried only innerwear and his camera bag, staunchly refusing to help with anyone else’s luggage. Meanwhile, Ankit packed a bag containing the essentials for him—Old Monk and Black Dog whisky, naturally.

We began our journey chanting “Hara Hara Mahadev” as Bikshu led the way. The trail took us through rocky paths, grassy meadows, and serene apple farms, though the trees were bare as it wasn’t apple season. As the trek warmed our bodies, jackets came off, and we settled into a steady rhythm.

Each member of the group brought their own flair to the journey:

Umesh struggled with the trail, often scolding the others for carrying unnecessary luggage, much to the amusement of Goutham, who loved debating him.
Prudhvi kept the energy high by quoting movie dialogues.
Ankit, ever the speedster, stayed ahead of the group, deep in conversation with Bikshu.
I sang songs, adding a lighthearted touch to the trek.
We took breaks at small stalls along the way, savoring steaming green tea, Maggi, and bread omelets. Hours later, as evening set in, we arrived at our first checkpoint: Juda Ka Talab, a stunning frozen lake surrounded by snow-draped trees.

After placing our luggage in the tents, we gathered around to enjoy tea, basking in the breathtaking scenery. The setting was surreal—perfect for capturing photos, dancing, and soaking in the mountain vibe. Dinner that night was simple yet delicious: chapati, dal, and rice. The meal transported us back to our college days in Himachal Pradesh, igniting nostalgic memories.

Later, with the cold creeping in, we gathered for a few shots of Old Monk to keep us warm. The night was filled with laughter as we teased Umesh about his love stories and recounted embarrassing moments from the past.

As the campfire dimmed, we crawled into our sleeping bags, buzzing with excitement for the next day’s trek. The mountains had begun working their magic, and this was only the beginning.

What if our figma designs get converted to UI in Android. Imagine how cool that would be
We already have a plugin that can do this (In Alpha stage) . It's called [relay](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/relay) 

Relay provides instant handoff of Android UI components between designers and developers.

Designers can use the ==Relay for Figma plugin== to annotate and package UI components for developer use, including information about layout, styling, dynamic content and interaction behavior and lot more custom properties.

Developers can use the ==Relay for Android Studio plugin== to import UI Packages and generate pixel-perfect Jetpack Compose code. This process provides instant layout and styling implementation, and speeds up the process of binding data.
- UI Packages can include styles and themes, and reference design system components that exist in code.

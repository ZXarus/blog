### **Plot Structure**

What is storytelling? It is the art/act of showing/telling about a journey, be it a character or world. It has a beginning, the middle(ups anb downs) and an ending. Each story has 3 important aspects plot, character and setting. These are considered as the 3 pillar of storytelling. In this post we are going to see about plot.

### **Plot**

Plot is structure of storytelling and is often used interchangebily with story but is different from it. Plot is more of 'what' and 'how' of a story. Story is considered as 'why' part. Plot tells us what is going to happen and how it is taking place, where as story tells why it is happening in the first place. Brandern Sanderson renowned novel and book writer distinguishes plot as two types, BIG P plot and SMALL p plot.

#### **BIG P plot vs SMALL p plot**

BIG P plot tells the overall narative of whats the story about. For example, In Life of PI, the plot is about a boy trying to survive and get back to land after the ship he is travelling is sunk into the ocean.

SMALL p plot is step by step progression leading to the conclusion of the story. The small problems and obstacles pile up into bigger problem that eventually the characters solve.

In the same example

PI's strugle to get on a life boat after the incident.

PI is on a boat with tiger in the middle of ocean.

PI gets his food lost in the ocean.

PI comes accross an island which is alive during night and deadly in the morning.

All these small problems contribute to the final conflict. These little incidents create the supense and doubt, helps character develop into something new along the way. 

### **Plot Framework**

Plot Framework is a concept of sanderson which helps in approaching the way of storytelling in a more compelling way. Promise, Progress and Payoff.

Plot becomes difficult when we are not sure to deliver what is being promised at the starting of a story. The progression to payoff has to be satisfying, whether the character has an upper/lower hand or both. 

#### **Promise Types**

##### **Tone Promise**

The tone set in the beginning gives an idea of what is to be expected from the world of the story.

If it is a comical story, early jokes need to be set so that a rough idea is emerged as to how the story is going to go.

In a horror theme, the first few scenes or pages has to be either horrific/spine chilling.

In satiricals, often naming and world is set in a different way.

##### **Story Promise**

The broader aspect of the story is told in this type of promise. Initially we are going to promise how the ending is going to be. All the hero's journey has somewhat similar  promise made in the beginning. In Kalki 2898 AD(Indian Film), we know in a broader perspect that Kalki is going to face the final boss and wipe evil from the world.

##### **Character and conflict Promise**

In this type we often start with who the character is, what they want and the strugle to as why they cannot achieve it.

##### **Structural Promise**

Here the promise to show an epic world which is entirely different from known genres. The scale is big and specific. Epic fantasies/Sci-fic are one such categories where worldbuilding is beyond conventional. The idea is to give audeince the clear promise.

### **Progress: Controlling Narrative**

This is where a writer is put to test and shines more. It is the creativity and magic of the writer which has to create the q sense of meaningful advancement. 

#### **Progress Types**

Storires can progress in differetn types.

##### **Information-Based progress**

Here often story progress depends on information gathered. 

in mysteries often story moves forward when clues discovered, suspects are ruled out and mystreries unraveling.

##### **Relationship progress**

Here the progress happens with character relationships.

Initial conflict and misunderstanding.

Gradual understanding.

Getting back ultimately at the end.

##### **Character Internal progress**

This is solely focused on character's internal progress.

Questioning beliefs.

Overcoming personal challenges and traumas.

Developing new skills and understanding what is needed to gain strength.

### **Payoff: The satisfying Ending**

A payoff is considered great if the promise is kept intact and fulfilling. It has to be memorable and amazing yet surprising. 

It should not be as expecting and should be surprising enough to get a wow factor.

##### **Twists: A Careful Narrative Promise**

Now suppose you are promised a gift to your loved ones on a special occasion. But when the time is close to fulfilling the promise, you get an even more surprising gift. The idea is to gradually make them believe that eventually something more amazing is promised and delivered.

The key to twist is.

An Initial promise.

A gradual redirection of expectations.

A resolutio that feels surprising and satisfying.



### **Strategies for Effective Payoffs**

Create genuine doubt by:

Introducing real obstacles

Making the promise seem impossible to fulfill

Using red herrings and escalations

Provide plausible deniability by:

Giving readers/audience just enough doubt

Making the ultimate resolution feel earned, not cheap

Match the payoff to your core story by:

Identifying the soul of your narrative

Ensuring the climax reflects the most important plot line

### **Final Thoughts**

The ultimate goal of storytelling is to provide a feel of satisfaction to the reader/audience. The methods are meant to be a guiding lines in achieving this feet but should not be a blocker to it. Following the above mentioned rules strictly shouldn't be ones aim in storytelling. A writer's job is to eliminate potential flaws in a plot and take risks in creating a wonderful, surprising yet meaninglful story which resonates with the people and makes them go awe.
